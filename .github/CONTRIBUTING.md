# Contributing

As long as your pull request doesn't break the app in any way or conflict with an ongoing change (check the open issues first or send me [an email](mailto:dev@jfenn.me) to make sure this doesn't happen), it will likely be accepted. I have a lot of projects and may not get around to reviewing pull requests right away. If you have contributed to this project before and would like to be added to this repository as a collaborator, feel free to send me [an email](mailto:dev@jfenn.me) and ask.

## Branches

I don't use branches because I'm lazy. If you want to make a branch, feel free to do so, just be aware that I will completely ignore it and push my changes to master anyway, because I'm special.

## Build Instructions

This project has certian icon sets missing from the open source repository, as they are under a different license. This will not affect how you compile the project, as I am using the "hacky" method of getting resource ids for these icons from strings at runtime. Everything else should work as normal.
